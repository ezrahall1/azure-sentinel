<h1>RDP brute force attempts on VM acting as a honeypot</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, my focus is on demonstrating the implementation of a cloud-based SIEM solution. Additionally, I will set up a virtual machine in the cloud to serve as a honeypot, deliberately exposing vulnerabilities to the internet. My objective is to monitor and log attacks originating from different IP addresses across the globe. Subsequently, I plan to extract the data related to failed logins and integrate it into Azure Sentinel. The final step involves presenting this information on a world map, allowing for a visual representation of the diverse geographical sources of these attacks.

<h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
Through the completion of this project, I gained insights into the functionality of Azure Sentinel and the advantages it brings to your environment. Azure Sentinel stands out as a scalable, cloud-native solution encompassing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration Automated Response (SOAR). This platform efficiently gathers data from diverse sources, conducts data correlation, visualizes information, and processes it within a unified dashboard. Its capabilities extend to collecting, detecting, investigating, and responding to security threats and incidents, making it a comprehensive tool for enhancing security in your environment.
