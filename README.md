<h1>Azure Sentinel</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I will be demonstrating how to set up a cloud based SIEM, as well as virtual machine in the cloud which will be the honeypot. It will be have vulnerabilities to the internet which I will monitor and log the attacks from different ip addresses, from different countries all over the world. I will extract the failed log on data and ingest it into Azure Sentinel and present it on a world map so you can visualize where the attacks are coming from.
